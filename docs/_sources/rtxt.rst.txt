Sections
++++++++

Sections are identified through their titles, which are marked up with adornment: "underlines" below the title text, or underlines and matching "overlines" above the title. More details can be found at: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#sections

Paragraphs
++++++++++

The paragraph is the most basic block in a reST document. 
Paragraphs are simply chunks of text separated by one or 
more blank lines. As in Python, indentation is significant 
in reST, so all lines of the same paragraph must be 
left-aligned to the **same level of indentation**. More 
details can be found at: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#paragraphs

General Paragraphs
------------------

reStructuredText:

.. code-block:: rst

	This is the first demo paragraph. The blank line above 
	the first line is required; The blank line below the last
	line is required. 

	This is the second demo paragraph. The blank line above
