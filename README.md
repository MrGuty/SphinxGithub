# Sphinx Github Webpages Tutorial	

 Website:  https://runawayhorse001.github.io/SphinxGithub


 This is a shared repository for my Sphinx Github page notes. In this repository, I will share some of my valueable experiences in using Python decumentation ``Sphinx`` with ``Github`` webpage.   

The tutorials assume that the reader has a preliminary knowledge of ``programing``, ``LaTex`` and ``Linux``. And this document is generated automatically by using sphinx.
